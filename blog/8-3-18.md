Hello there again, you're back to read more of my life. Well not much has happened expect I've been in school for two days so far. New vice-principal, new career management teacher, new junior advisory and oh boy it's gonna be wild run. I mean it's not much different from last year.

So I've been thinking about the official date to post my weekly blogs and to be honest I don't know but I'm gonna try to do it every friday. I'm also doing this meme of week which is the meme I find the funniest for the week.

Meme of the week:
