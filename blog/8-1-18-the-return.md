# 8/1/18 - The Return

So today is the last day I have before school starts and it's currently 7:49 P.M by the time I'm writing this. Like most, I don't wanna go back to school and I got to a early college which combines college and high school class. This semester I have BUS-137 which is a business class, civics, and biology. From what I've been told the civics teacher gives a lot of homework so this is gonna be a fun one.

I do hope it all goes well for me this school year and my blogging page. i
