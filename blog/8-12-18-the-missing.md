# 8/12/18 - The missing

Well after a week of being in school, I've noticed that many former classmate have left the school. I guess it was to much work for them or probably are still in vacation. If they are in vacation they lost the opportunity on exam exemption. This year or semester, the school is offering this amazing opportunity to skip exams by having an A with 3 or less absences or, have a B with 2 or less absences. I do plan to go for the first option.
