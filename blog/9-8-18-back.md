# 9/8/18 - back

So I haven't been blogging for about a month now. Sorry. Though I don't think many are keeping up with this anyway. To be honest, I forgot I had this blog thing going a while until I typed juan in my search box.

Anyway, life has been going great so far. School has been going great so far. I still am learning how to program and to be more exact, I think I'm going full web developer. I'm not gonna abandon my other projects like my Discord bots. I still plan to work on them or even create more. My life so far is currently going well.
