# Euphoria Bot

Euphoria bot used to be named Juanbot which was supposed to be my personal bot, but I created a server named Euphoria server which you all should join link [here](https://discord.gg/kWvkjh4). I wanted a bot for my server a personal bot. Recently I decided to redo the bot and name it Euphoriabot, and it also was recode time. I of course started to do all of the work, but soon later Lava jumped in and started to work on it too. The bot is still in a early development but should come out in near future.

Now feast your eyes on the process of the bot.

I deleted the entire code, all of it. Nothing was left in the repository expect the .gitignore, README.md, and all of those juicy files github does.
